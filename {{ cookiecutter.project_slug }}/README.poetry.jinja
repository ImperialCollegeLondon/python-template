This is a Python application that uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for packaging
and dependency management. It also provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks
(for [ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) and
[mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)) and automated tests using
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## For developers

This is a Python application that uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) for packaging
and dependency management. It also provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks
for various linters and formatters and automated tests using
[pytest](https://pytest.org/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with a dedicated GitHub Action.
