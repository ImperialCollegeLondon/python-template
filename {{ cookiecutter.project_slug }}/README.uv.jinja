This is a Python application that uses [uv] for packaging and dependency management.
It  provides [`pre-commit`][pre-commit] hooks for various linters
and formatters and automated tests using [`pytest`][pytest] and [GitHub Actions].
Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with a dedicated GitHub Action, this can
be removed and replaced with [pre-commit.ci] if using a public repo.

It was developed by the [Imperial College Research Software Engineering Team].

## Usage

To get started:

1. [Download and install uv] following the instructions for your OS.
2. Set up the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. Initialise the Git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment, or just preface your commands with `uv run` to use
the virtual environment (see [uv activate] for more info):

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   <command>
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   uv run <command>
   ```

5. Install the pre-commit git hooks:

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit install
   ```

6. Update the pre-commit hooks

   ```bash
   uv run pre-commit autoupdate
   ```

7. Run the main app:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
   ```

8. Run the tests:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   ```

9. Create an initial commit (it's possible there might be some failures in pre-commit):

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

## Updating Dependencies

Use the commands `uv add <package>` and `uv remove <package>` to add or remove dependencies.

- Use the optional flag `--dev` to add/remove development dependencies.
- Include the optional flag `--group <group-name>` to add/remove dependencies from specific groups.
- These will automatically update the `pyproject.toml` file.

For further information, see the [uv] docs for managing dependencies.
