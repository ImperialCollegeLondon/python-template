This is a Python application that uses [uv] for packaging and dependency management.
It  provides [`pre-commit`][pre-commit] hooks for various linters
and formatters and automated tests using [`pytest`][pytest] and [GitHub Actions].
Pre-commit hooks are automatically kept updated with a dedicated GitHub Action, this can
be removed and replaced with [pre-commit.ci] if using a public repo. The package version
is dynamically generated from the most recent git tag using
[`setuptools-scm`][setuptools-scm].

It was developed by the [Imperial College Research Software Engineering Team].

## Usage

To get started:

1. [Download and install uv] following the instructions for your OS.
1. Activate a git repository (required for `pre-commit` and the package versioning with
`setuptools-scm`):

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

1. Install the package and dependencies and set up the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment, or just preface your commands with `uv run` to use
the virtual environment (see [uv activate] for more info):

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    <command>
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    uv run <command>
    ```

1. Install the pre-commit git hooks:

    ```bash
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```

1. Update the pre-commit hooks

    ```bash
    uv run pre-commit autoupdate
    ```

1. Run the main app:

    ```bash
    uv run python -m {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
    ```

1. Run the tests:

    ```bash
    uv run pytest
    ```

1. Create an initial commit (it's possible there might be some failures in pre-commit):

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

## Updating Dependencies

Use the commands `uv add <package>` and `uv remove <package>` to add or remove dependencies.

- Use the optional flag `--dev` to add/remove development dependencies.
- Include the optional flag `--group <group-name>` to add/remove dependencies from specific groups.
- These will automatically update the `pyproject.toml` file.

For further information, see the [uv] docs for managing dependencies.
